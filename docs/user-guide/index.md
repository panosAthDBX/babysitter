# Babysitter User Guide

**Babysitter enforces obedience on agentic workforces: it runs your workflow as deterministic, code-defined orchestration on any supported harness, where the orchestrator can only do what your process permits. Manage extremely complex, multi-agent workflows with a hook-enforced mandatory stop after every step — enforcement, not assistance.**

New here? Jump straight to [Start here](#start-here) for the 20-minute path, or use the [task-based](#i-want-to) and [role-based](#by-role-and-level) entry points below to go directly to the page you need.

---

## Start here

The fastest path from zero to a working run:

1. [Installation](./getting-started/installation.md) — install the CLI and your harness plugin (5 min)
2. [Quickstart](./getting-started/quickstart.md) — run your first workflow (10 min)
3. [First Run Deep Dive](./getting-started/first-run.md) — understand what just happened (10 min)

Prefer to learn the ideas first? Read [What is Babysitter?](#what-is-babysitter-start-here-if-youre-new) (2 min), then see **[how the whole ecosystem fits together](./architecture.md)** (vision + diagram + runtime flow) and the [Two-Loops Architecture](./features/two-loops-architecture.md).

Want the lay of the land first? The [Ecosystem Overview](./ecosystem/overview.md) tours every component (the core engine, the adapters family, atlas, genty, the observer dashboard, kradle, and kip-sdk) and helps you choose which you need.

## What is Babysitter? (Start Here if You're New)

**Babysitter makes agentic work obedient.** It rests on three pillars:

1. **Deterministic process execution** — your workflow is real JavaScript code (`async function process(inputs, ctx)`), and the orchestrator can *only* do what that code permits. State is event-sourced in an immutable journal, so any run can be replayed and resumed from any point.
2. **Complex agentic workflows** — tasks, breakpoints, sleeps, parallel dispatch, dependencies, and sub-agent delegation across harnesses. A single headless entry point can orchestrate multi-agent work, delegating each task to whichever installed harness is best suited.
3. **Policy / process adherence (obedience)** — after *every* step there is a hook-enforced **mandatory stop**, a process check ("what does the process permit next?"), and a decision: permit the next task, or halt until a gate passes. **Enforcement, not assistance — gates block progression until satisfied; they're not suggestions.**

### The Problem Babysitter Solves

When you turn an AI agent loose on real work, it tends to keep going on its own judgment — skipping steps, declaring "done" without evidence, and drifting from the process you intended. Babysitter removes that discretion: the agent does exactly what the process permits, nothing more, and cannot advance past a gate it hasn't satisfied.

One illustration of how a gate works is the familiar "try, check, fix, repeat" loop — a code-defined gate keeps iterating until its quality criterion is met, then permits the next step. That quality convergence is *one* consequence of code-defined gates, not the whole product.

### How It Works (In Plain English)

Your process is code; the orchestrator enforces it. After each step it stops, checks what the process permits next, and only then permits the next task — or halts until a gate passes. The loop below shows one such gate (a quality gate) doing its job:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  YOU: "Build a login page with tests"                           │
│                         ↓                                       │
│  BABYSITTER: Enforces your process; one gate iterates:          │
│    1. AI writes code                                            │
│    2. Tests run → 60% pass                                      │
│    3. AI fixes failures                                         │
│    4. Tests run → 85% pass                                      │
│    5. AI fixes remaining issues                                 │
│    6. Tests run → 95% pass ✓ Target met!                       │
│                         ↓                                       │
│  YOU: Review and approve the final result                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Terms You'll See

| Term | What It Means | Example |
|------|---------------|---------|
| **Process** | A workflow definition | "Build feature with TDD" |
| **Run** | One execution of a process | Running the TDD workflow for your login page |
| **Task** | A single step in the process | "Write tests", "Run linter", "Check coverage" |
| **Quality Gate** | A check that must pass | Tests must be 90% passing |
| **Breakpoint** | A pause for human approval | "Review this code before I deploy it" (handled in chat or via web UI) |
| **Iteration** | One try-check-fix cycle | Attempt #3 to pass the tests |
| **Convergence** | Improving until target met | Going from 60% → 85% → 95% |

### Your First 5 Minutes

**What you'll do:**
1. Install Babysitter (1 command)
2. Run a simple workflow (1 command)
3. See it iterate until tests pass
4. Approve the result

**What you'll learn:**
- How the orchestrator only does what your process permits
- What the mandatory stop and process check do after each step
- How to approve at breakpoints
- What a quality gate looks like (one gate type among several)

**What you'll see:**

```
/babysitter:call build a calculator with add, subtract, multiply, divide using TDD

Creating run: calculator-20260125-143012
Process: TDD Quality Convergence
Target: 90% quality

Iteration 1: Quality 65/100 - Tests: 6/10 passing
  → AI fixing test failures...

Iteration 2: Quality 82/100 - Tests: 9/10 passing
  → AI improving code coverage...

Iteration 3: Quality 95/100 - Target met! ✅

Claude: The implementation is complete. Quality score: 95/100.
        Do you approve the final result?
        [Approve] [Request Changes]

You: [Approve]

Done! Your calculator module is ready.
```

**Note:** Breakpoints (approval prompts) are handled directly in the chat when using Claude Code. No external service needed!

**The main command:** `/babysitter:call <your request>` handles everything automatically.
