/**
 * Milestone B — Credential-identity ALIAS canonicalization (AC-55) + deny-on-ambiguous
 * (AC-40a).
 *
 * The trusted credential→scope source (AC-40) canonicalizes aliases of ONE physical
 * credential (e.g. a KMS key referenced by ARN and by key-id) to a SINGLE
 * collision-resistant identity BEFORE the deny-on-ambiguous rule, so legitimate
 * multi-alias credentials are not falsely denied. The identity key is sha256 of the
 * credential's STABLE secret-store identity — never the value prefix, env-var name, or
 * an agent-supplied alias.
 *
 * OVERRIDING RULE: fail closed. An absent alias, an unknown identity, an ambiguous
 * identity (backed by >1 distinct credential), or ANY thrown exception → deny (no scope
 * guessed, never the narrower of two candidates).
