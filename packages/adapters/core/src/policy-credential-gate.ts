/**
 * Milestone D — GATE 3: credential-injection backstop (§9.3 / AC-23a / AC-40 /
 * AC-40a / AC-50 / AC-55).
 *
 * Before env / credential injection, GATE 3 verifies a credential attestation: a
 * policy-bound (scoped) credential is delivered ONLY when a valid
 * CommandAuthorization covers its scope. It mediates every credential-delivery
 * channel `spawn-invocation.ts` constructs:
 *   - env injection: docker `-e`, ssh `K=V`, k8s `env` / `--env`  (`*-env`);
 *   - docker `-v` file mounts                                     (`docker-mount`);
 *   - k8s secret / serviceaccount references                     (`k8s-secret`,
 *                                                                  `k8s-serviceaccount`).
 * With NO valid authorization the channel is OMITTED (env dropped, mount omitted,
 * secret/serviceaccount ref stripped); if the policy marks the credential REQUIRED,
 * the spawn is DENIED.
 *
 * The credential→scope tag comes from a TRUSTED, out-of-agent source (AC-40) keyed
 * by a COLLISION-RESISTANT identity (AC-40a); aliases of one physical credential
 * canonicalize to one identity (AC-55). An absent / ambiguous identity, or no
 * mediated scope, → deny (fail closed) — never inject an untagged credential, never
 * pick the narrower of two candidate scopes.
 *
 * GATE 3 is the LAST point before exec, so it RECOMPUTES argsHash / commandHash from
 * the exact spawn (TOCTOU, AC-32) and re-checks them against the authorization.
 *
 * BOUNDED, WARNED NON-GOAL (AC-50): credentials the process obtains WITHOUT
 * spawn-invocation constructing the delivery — IMDS / IRSA / workload-identity,
 * pre-existing mounts, image creds — cannot be gated. For a scoped credential with
 * no GATE-3-mediated scope, the gate fails closed (does not inject) and surfaces a
 * warning; it does NOT claim a backstop for such an action.
 *
 * OVERRIDING RULE: fail closed. Any verification / parse / resolution error, or any
 * thrown exception, is a deny / no-injection. No fallbacks.
