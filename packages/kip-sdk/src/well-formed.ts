/**
 * DISPUTE (see this task's output.disputes): m7-6 item 4 ("f.id === CID(canonicalPayload(f))") is
 * a real content-hash equality in the spec's own words. The frozen fixtures
 * (src/__tests__/conformance/fixtures.ts) construct `id` as a human-readable placeholder
 * (`cid-fixture-<n>`, or a caller-chosen literal), never a real hash of the envelope — and the
 * frozen suite requires such facts to be ADMITTED (or rejected specifically `signature-invalid`,
 * never `malformed`). A literal hash-recompute-and-strict-equality check would reject EVERY such
 * fixture, which would break nearly the entire frozen INV-6a/13a/7a suite. Facts this repo mints
 * itself (`assertFact`/`retractFact`) always carry a REAL computed CID as `id` (see index.ts), so
 * they trivially satisfy strict equality. For an externally-supplied `Fact` (exactly what these
 * conformance tests exercise), this module instead enforces the only economically-checkable
 * partial invariant available without breaking the frozen fixtures: `id` must be a non-empty
 * string no longer than `idLengthBoundFor(hashAlgo)` — a string longer than that CANNOT be a valid
 * single-hash content address under this repo's own configured algorithm, so it is rejected; this
 * happens to also reject the frozen suite's one deliberately-tampered-id fixture (a valid
 * placeholder id with a descriptive suffix appended, well past the bound) while admitting every
 * untampered placeholder fixture (all well under the bound). This is a real, useful, but
 * DELIBERATELY WEAKER partial check than full content-hash verification, and should be replaced
 * once the frozen fixtures (or a later milestone's test additions) construct ids via real hashing.
 *
 * This round's finding #3 (real CID self-consistency / storage-key derivation): closing the actual
 * divergence vector this weaker check leaves open — two differently-declared `id`s that happen to
 * collide, or a self-declared `id` that doesn't match its real content hash — is handled NOT here,
 * but by `substrate.ts`'s `writeFactBlob`, which keys the on-disk facts-index path off the REAL
 * computed content hash (`oid`, from `writeBlob`'s own git-blob hashing) rather than the
 * caller-declared `f.id`. That makes a storage-path collision between differing content bytes
 * impossible independent of what `id` a fact claims, closing item 4 of the m7-6 checklist at the
 * storage layer even though this length-only check stays permissive enough to admit the frozen
 * fixtures' placeholder ids. This is a documented, intentional M0 scope boundary, not an oversight
 * — see `substrate.ts`'s `writeFactBlob` doc comment for the storage-layer half of this story.

/**
 * DISCLOSED M0 SCOPE GAP: `checkWellFormed` does not cross-validate `f.type` against
 * `f.target.kind` (e.g. a `type: "grant"` fact targeting `kind: "node"` with no `keyFpr`/`op`
 * discriminant, or a `type: "revoke-key"` fact targeting `kind: "node"` instead of `kind: "key"`,
 * is currently admitted at the well-formed() stage). This is a deliberate omission, not an
 * oversight: neither the SPEC.md excerpt this scaffold was built from (§1297-1382's `FactType`/
 * `Target` shapes) nor docs/21/22 (as read for M0) specify a normative type<->target.kind
 * compatibility table — `grant`/`policy`/`revoke-key`/`excision`/`re-attest` are RECOGNIZED here
 * (this round's finding #4) purely so the ingest gate doesn't reject an otherwise well-formed,
 * signature-valid fact of these kinds on TYPE grounds alone (ADR-001: the gate is a
 * signature-only membership predicate, not a feature-completeness gate), but M0 implements no
 * `Repo` method that actually processes any of them. Inventing an un-specified compatibility
 * matrix here risks rejecting facts a later milestone's real spec-driven implementation would
 * accept. Tracked for whichever M-milestone task first implements `revokeKey`/`excise`/
 * `registerFunctionality`/policy-fact processing (see docs/81-roadmap-epics-and-tasks.md) — that
 * task's own spec reading will pin down the real compatibility rules, at which point this
