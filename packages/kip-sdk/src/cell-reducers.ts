 * cell-reducers.ts — the M1 MAJOR-FINDING minimal per-cell reducer-selection SEAM (SPEC.md §3.4's
 * `CellReducerRef`/`CellReducer<V>` types + resolution-table rows for `gset`/`pncounter`; the M1
 * roadmap's explicit commitment to reducers beyond `lww-hlc`).
 *
 * SCOPE NOTE (see this task's `disputes` output): `index.ts`'s `Repo` surface exposes no
 * `NodeKindDef`/`EdgeKindDef`/schema-registration API, so there is no PER-ONTOLOGY-KIND seam to
 * hang a "every cell of kind X uses `gset`" declaration off of yet. What DOES exist (round-3 wiring
 * fix) is a PER-CELL-KEY association: `KipRepo`'s public constructor takes a `cellReducers`
 * `(cellKey) -> CellReducerRef` map that `proj.ts`'s `reduceCellByRef` consults on every
 * `getNode`/`getEdge`/`query` fold — so `gsetReducer`/`pncounterReducer` ARE reachable end-to-end
 * from a real `KipRepo` for any cell a caller names, and `getNode`/`getEdge` fall back to the DEFAULT
 * `lww-hlc` sweep (SPEC.md §3.4's resolution table) only for cells no association names. This module
 * does NOT invent the missing per-ontology-KIND registration surface (that would risk shipping an
 * un-spec'd API a later milestone's real ontology work would have to either honor or break). It
 * proves the `CellReducer` ABSTRACTION itself — the part SPEC.md actually specifies
 * (`reduce(facts): CellSegment<V>[]`, "a PURE function over the WHOLE set of facts for ONE cell,
 * deterministic, total, pre-sorted input") — has more than one real, independently unit-tested
 * implementation: `gsetReducer` and `pncounterReducer` alongside `lww-hlc`'s existing sweep in
 * `proj.ts`. `resolveCellReducer`/`reducerFor` below are the minimal "a way to associate one with a
 * cell" seam: a caller-supplied `(cellKey) -> CellReducerRef` map dispatched to a concrete
 * implementation — unit-testable directly against raw `Fact` arrays AND driven end-to-end through
 * `KipRepo({ cellReducers })` (see inv-3.test.ts / inv-7.test.ts's reducer-selection tests).

 *
 * ROOT-CAUSE FIX (round 3, vulnerable site #4): the dedup-by-tag map previously did
 * `deltasByTag.set(f.id, delta)` — a plain last-write-wins `Map` write. That is sound for a
 * genuinely byte-identical re-offered fact (same tag, same delta, a true no-op), but NOT for a

 * of the two deltas ended up in the Map — and therefore the summed total — silently depended on
 * which one was LAST in this replica's local `facts` array (ingest order), an order-dependent sum
 * masquerading as the reducer's advertised "commutative, no conflict possible" guarantee. Fixed:
 * group every asserting fact by its tag FIRST, then for a tag with more than one DISTINCT delta,
 * pick one deterministic representative via `compareByContent` (content-derived, never array/
 * ingest-position-derived) — so the summed total is now a pure function of the fact SET regardless
 * of ingest order, closing the divergence without inventing a "sum both deltas" semantics the
 * SPEC's "tags dedup" text never licenses for a forged/colliding tag.
