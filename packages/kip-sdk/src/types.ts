/**
 * M4/T5.5: `RecallQuery` widened to the normative docs/26 §5.1 shape (the round-4 realization of the
 * former minimal-placeholder's own `TODO(M4/T11.4)`). Every field is docs/26 §5.1-declared:
 *
 * - `text`: exact/keyword GRAPH-SEED input, AND (D-57 / ADR-B17) the source kip embeds when `semantic`
 *   is opted in. By DEFAULT (no `semantic`, no `embedding`) kip does NOT embed it and the vector half
 *   is inert — pure lexical + graph, the pre-ADR-B17 behavior. A `text` exact-match on a candidate's
 *   `content` cell is a GRAPH SEED (§5.1 flowchart `G0`): the matched node is itself a hop-0 candidate
 *   (it earns a graph rank even with no inbound edge and no vector half), so a pure-`text` query
 *   surfaces the matched nodes THEMSELVES, not only their graph-expanded neighbors.
 * - `semantic`: D-57 (semantic half) OPT-IN — when `true`, kip embeds `text` itself and drives the
 *   vector half (see the field's own doc). Absent ⇒ unchanged behavior.
 * - `embedding`: the CALLER-SUPPLIED query vector (N2: kip consumes embeddings, never produces them),
 *   the ANN candidate seed. Corpus vectors are built OUTSIDE the deterministic `proj` fold, via the
 *   injectable `dispatchMicroagent` embedding seam (§5.3 accelerator boundary — recall/embeddings
 *   are non-deterministic accelerators, NEVER a `proj` input, so they can never perturb `/heads`
 *   byte-identity, INV-5). NOTE: the M4 vector half is an EXACT brute-force cosine scan (recall-equal
 *   to exact-kNN by construction) computed PER-CALL — there is no HNSW/IVF ANN index and no
 *   content-addressed embedding cache yet; the pluggable ANN accelerator + incremental cache (§5.3)
 *   are a named follow-up (see `dispatchEmbedding` / `computeRecall` vector-half comments).
 * - `filters`: candidate restriction (§5.1). ALL THREE sub-fields are honored — `kind` (node-kind),
 *   `props` (every named prop must match the candidate's covering value), and `edgeKinds` (the
 *   candidate must be incident to ≥1 as-of-valid edge of a named kind). None is a silent no-op.
 * - `scope`: DEFERRED to M8 tenancy — NOT applied here. Consistent with `withScope`/`pin`/`subscribe`,
 *   whose `scope.tenant`/`scope.namespace` narrowing is likewise unimplemented at this milestone
 *   (this SDK's fixtures never namespace `EID`s by tenant, so there is no sound narrowing to apply).
 *   `computeRecall` documents this loudly as a NAMED GAP rather than pretending it restricts candidates
 *   — see the `q.scope` handling in `computeRecall`.
 * - `asOf`: the bitemporal frontier the whole pipeline (candidate visibility, edge validity, salience
 *   recency) is bounded by (§5.2/§5.4, m-7).
 * - `expand`: bounded, OPT-IN graph expansion (docs/26 §5.1: "MUST be bounded and opt-in, never
 *   unbounded") — `hops` + optional `maxFanout` caps.
 * - `k`: REQUIRED top-k cap (docs/26 §5.1 declares `k: number`; docs/40 "MUST NOT drop a declared
 *   field"). The fused ranked result is ALWAYS truncated to `k` — recall never returns the whole fused
 *   candidate set (no silent unbounded-result fallback, §5.1 "top-k results" + context-dilution intent).
 * - `rank`: RRF + salience-composition knobs (§5.1/§5.4). `rrfK` defaults to 60 (the canonical RRF
 *   constant). The salience half maps each knob onto a §5.4 `SalienceModel` weight:
 *   `recencyWeight`=`w_r`, `confidenceWeight`=`w_c`, `salienceWeight`=`w_g` (centrality). All default
 *   to 0 (salience is OPT-IN — a term participates ONLY when its weight is positive, so a pure
 *   vector/graph query is never silently salience-perturbed and INV-5's pure-vector measurement is
 *   exact). `halfLifeMs` is the §5.4 recency decay constant (defaults to `KIP_SALIENCE_HALF_LIFE_MS`).
 *   The fourth §5.4 term `w_a·accessFreq` is an EXPLICIT M4 DEFERRAL (see `computeRecall` salience-half
 *   NAMED GAP): M4 exposes no public API to author `read`-event facts, and recall itself MUST NOT emit
 *   read facts (that would make it observer-effecting, §5.4 m-7 closure) — so `accessFreq` has no
 *   convergence-safe input surface at this milestone and is scoped out with the citation, never
 *   silently folded in.
