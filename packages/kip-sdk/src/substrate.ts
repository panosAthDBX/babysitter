/**
 * substrate.ts — the git object write-path (T1.1/T1.5 slice): "Git is the ONLY durable store"
 * (docs/22 §1). ADR-B1 (accepted) names isomorphic-git as M0-M3's plumbing library; this file
 * does NOT import it (kip-sdk's package.json currently declares zero runtime dependencies, and
 * ADR-B6/this task's instructions are explicit: no `npm install`, no lockfile edits, this round
 * ships with only the devDeps already present). Instead it writes REAL, standard git LOOSE OBJECTS
 * by hand — `zlib.deflateSync("blob <len>\0<content>")` under `<dir>/objects/<hh>/<rest>`, hashed
 * with the manifest's configured algorithm (SHA-1 or SHA-256, docs/22 §1.3) via `node:crypto` —
 * so a real `git cat-file`/`git fsck` against this directory sees legitimate blob objects. This is
 * flagged in this task's `disputes` output: swapping this hand-rolled writer for isomorphic-git's
 * tree/commit/ref plumbing (full ADR-B1) is follow-up work once the dependency is actually
 * installed from a Linux/CI-consistent environment (ADR-B6).
 *
 * What IS implemented here: content-addressed, idempotent blob writes (INV-7's CID-dedup, at the
 * storage layer) and the `/facts/<shardHi>/<shardLo>/<oid>.json` shard layout (docs/22 §1.3).
 * What is NOT yet implemented: tree objects, commits, and refs (T1.5's "batched commit +
 * durability signalling" is scaffolded via `SeqTipStore` below for T1.2.5's durable persistence
 * requirement, but full commit/ref assembly is left `unimplemented` per this task's scope note
 * that `txn`/`commit` stay throwing stubs).
 *
 * INVARIANT: canonical fact content lives ONLY in the oid-keyed object store (`writeBlob`/
 * `readBlobContent`, keyed by the fact's REAL content hash). The caller-declared `factId` is used
 * ONLY as an eviction-witness leaf filename (`facts/by-id/<oid>/<factId>.json`, see `writeFactBlob`/
 * `writeFactWitness` below) — never as a content key or path-collision-relevant identifier, because
 * well-formed.ts's item-4 self-consistency check is a documented length-only heuristic, not a real
 * hash-recompute-and-compare, so two admitted facts can legitimately declare the same `factId` with
 * different content. See round2-storage-collision-fix.test.ts and round3-witness-collision-fix.test.ts
 * for the regression tests covering the attacks this design closes (a grindable shard-prefix content
 * collision, and a shared eviction-witness file masking an unrelated fact's eviction, respectively).

/**
 * D-36 ROUND-6 CRITIC FIX (CRITICAL, convergence-safety — tip-persistence crash-safety): thrown by
 * `SeqTipStore.load()`/`CommitTipStore.load()` when the tip file EXISTS on disk but its content
 * fails to parse as JSON — a corrupt/torn file. Before this fix, both loaders did a bare
 * `JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(...))` with no guard at all: a parse failure threw a raw, unexplained
 * `SyntaxError` straight out of `.load()`, and since `getSubstrate()` (index.ts) calls both loaders
 * UNGUARDED during `KipRepo.open()`, that raw throw PERMANENTLY BRICKED every future `getSubstrate()`
 * call (i.e. the entire repo) against that directory — with no indication to the caller of what was
 * actually wrong or how to recover.
 *
 * `writeJsonAtomic` (above) now makes a torn write-in-progress file structurally impossible going
 * forward (see its own doc comment), so a parse failure here means either (a) a pre-existing corrupt
 * file from BEFORE this fix was deployed, or (b) genuine external/manual corruption of the file —
 * either way this is surfaced LOUDLY with a distinct, typed `.code` and the file's own path, giving
 * an operator a clear diagnosis, rather than either an opaque raw-`SyntaxError` crash (the pre-fix
 * behavior) OR silently discarding the file's content and starting over as if it never existed (a
 * fallback CLAUDE.md prohibits: that would let a real, durable seq/commit tip silently regress
 * without any operator visibility, reopening exactly the seq-collision hazard this same round's
 * OTHER fix — the `currentFacts()` cross-validation in `getSubstrate()`, index.ts — closes for the
 * ordinary stale-but-parseable case).
