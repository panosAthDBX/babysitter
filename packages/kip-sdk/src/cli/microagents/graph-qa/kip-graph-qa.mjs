/**
 * graph-QA microagent entrypoint (spec kip-graph-qa.md §2/§3). The genty `MicroagentRunner` spawns
 * this executable: it reads a `MicroagentInvocation` from stdin (`{ question, asOf?, k?, repoDir }`),
 * performs READ-ONLY kip retrieval (recall/query/asOf/getNode) over the resolved lens, synthesizes an
 * answer with `runtime.model`, and writes a `{ answer, abstained, citations, usedFacts }` object to
 * stdout (INV-A1: it authors NOTHING; N5: it abstains rather than fabricates).
 *
 * This is the bundled, standalone-binary carrier of the QA manifest (spec §5.1 `discoveryDirs`). The
 * REAL production retrieval→citation→abstention pipeline now lives in-process in
 * `src/cli/ask.ts`'s `defaultDispatchMicroagent`, which opens the repo READ-ONLY and calls the
 * fully-real, unit-tested `answerQuestion` (`src/graph-qa/index.ts`) with a genty-model `synthesize`.
 * This `.mjs` remains only as the subprocess carrier for a host that dispatches the manifest through
 * genty's own subprocess runner; absent host wiring of the read surface it abstains rather than
 * guessing (N5).
