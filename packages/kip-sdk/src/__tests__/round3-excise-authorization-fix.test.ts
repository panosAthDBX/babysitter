/**
 * round3-excise-authorization-fix.test.ts — ADDITIVE regression coverage for milestone M3 ROUND 3's
 * adversarial-review findings against round 2's excise-authorization design (round-2 min score
 * 24/100, WORSE than round 1's 34/100 — round 2's own "fix #1" was trivially bypassable).
 *
 * 1. ROOT-CAUSE (CRITICAL): `collectExcisions` (proj.ts) trusted the excision MARKER's own
 *    self-declared `origFingerprint` field when deciding "self-excision" — an attacker who owns a
 *    real, legitimately-registered keypair could craft a validly-self-signed marker targeting a
 *    VICTIM's real fact (by real content oid) while setting `origFingerprint` to the ATTACKER'S OWN
 *    fingerprint, trivially satisfying `markerFingerprint === origFingerprint` even though the
 *    attacker never authored the victim's data. FIXED by grounding the authorization decision in the
 *    REAL, admitted candidate fact's OWN `provenance.publicKeyFingerprint` — read directly off a
 *    genuine `Fact` object this replica independently verified/admitted — NEVER the marker's
 *    self-declared payload. See test (a).
 *
 * 2. SECOND ISSUE (MAJOR): `isAuthorizedExcisionMarker`'s permissive "never-registered-so-permissive"
 *    fallback branch is grounded in `KeyRegistry`, an in-memory-only `Map` that a reopened `KipRepo`
 *    rebuilds from scratch (own keypair + genesis `rootKeys` only), losing every peer key learned via
 *    a past `sync()`. A genuinely-authenticated third-party fact — correctly protected while its
 *    author's key is registered in memory — became censorable by the SAME attacker marker after a
 *    routine process restart. FIXED by durably persisting `sync()`-learned peer-key registrations
 *    (`KeyRegistryStore`, substrate.ts) and re-seeding `KipRepo.keyRegistry` from that store on
 *    reopen. See test (b).
 *
 * 3. Positive control: legitimate self-excision (a replica erasing its own genuinely-authored data)
 *    must keep working exactly as before, including the typed `"excised"` placeholder for a
 *    historical `asOf` read through the erased interval (INV-9's own frozen requirement) — now backed
 *    by `KipRepo.selfWitnessedExcisionOids` rather than the marker's own self-declared payload for the
 *    "target currently absent from this replica's admitted set" case every `excise()` call's own
 *    subsequent re-fold hits. See test (c).
 *
 * Each `it` below is written to demonstrate the CURRENT (post-round-3-fix) behavior; the comment at
 * each key assertion states what the PRE-FIX (round-2) code would have done instead — verified by
 * hand against proj.ts's round-2 `collectExcisions`/`isAuthorizedExcisionMarker` call shape (which
 * evaluated authorization against `parseExcisionMarker(f).origFingerprint`, the marker's own
 * self-declared field, for every marker regardless of whether a real candidate fact was present).
