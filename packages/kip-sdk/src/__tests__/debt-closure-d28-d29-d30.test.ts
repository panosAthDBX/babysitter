/**
 * debt-closure-d28-d29-d30.test.ts — ADDITIVE regression coverage for closing three small,
 * independently-tracked implementation debts recorded in `packages/kip-sdk/docs/DEBTS.md`:
 *
 * D-29 (leaking static registry, index.ts): `KipRepo.registry` (a static `Map<ReplicaId, KipRepo>`)
 * self-registered every constructed instance but had no removal path, leaking every `KipRepo` (and
 * its `Substrate`/`keyRegistry`/`selfWitnessedExcisionOids`) forever in a long-lived host process.
 * Fixed by adding an explicit `KipRepo.prototype.close()` that removes `this.replicaId` from the
 * registry. Test (a) below proves `close()` actually removes the entry — tested INDIRECTLY (the
 * cleanest available seam) via `sync()`: a remote resolves fine before `close()` and fails to
 * resolve ("unknown remote") immediately after, which is only possible if the registry entry is
 * genuinely gone.
 *
 * D-28 (non-durable `selfWitnessedExcisionOids`, index.ts): unlike `keyRegistry` (durably re-seeded
 * from `KeyRegistryStore` in `getSubstrate()`), `selfWitnessedExcisionOids` was populated ONLY by
 * live `excise()` calls and started empty again after a process restart / fresh `KipRepo` pointed at
 * the same `dir`. Fixed by adding `SelfWitnessedExcisionStore` (substrate.ts, mirroring
 * `KeyRegistryStore`'s exact load/save shape) and wiring it into `excise()` (write-through) and
 * `getSubstrate()` (re-seed). Test (b) below proves a self-excised fact's typed `"excised"`
 * placeholder survives a close()+reopen of a `KipRepo` pointed at the same directory.
 *
 * D-30 (mistyped `SyncReport.tip`/`MergeReport.tip`, index.ts): both were typed `CID` (a real git
 * object id per the type catalog) but populated with `computeFactSetDigest(...)`, a fact-set digest,
 * not a git-resolvable commit id (there is no regenerated commit DAG yet, see D-27). Fixed by
 * introducing a distinct `FactSetDigest` type alias and retyping both fields to it — a pure
 * type-level change, the actual runtime value is UNCHANGED. Because both `CID` and `FactSetDigest`
 * are (necessarily, per the task's "don't change the runtime value" constraint) plain `string`
 * aliases with no branding, there is no way to write a runtime assertion that would fail to compile
 * under the OLD typing and succeed under the NEW one — the authoritative signal for this item is
 * `tsc --noEmit` passing (verified separately, see this task's summary). Test (c) below is
 * therefore a source-level regression guard (grep the field declarations) that would fail if a
 * future edit reverted `tip`'s declared type back to `CID`, plus a sanity check that the runtime
 * value itself is untouched (still whatever `computeFactSetDigest` produces).
