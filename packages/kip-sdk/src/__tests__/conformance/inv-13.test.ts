/**
 * INV-13 (FULL FORM) — signature-valid ⇒ eventually-admitted-on-receipt (non-vacuous substrate
 * convergence, C3-1/C3-2/M3-4).
 *
 * docs/60-conformance-and-testability.md#inv-13 (verbatim core): "every signature-valid fact offered
 * to any replica is admitted by every replica that receives it, upon receipt … regardless of clock
 * skew, partition length, or whether its signing key's registration has arrived yet — and its logical
 * membership is NEVER dropped … The suite delivers signature-valid facts under adversarial clock
 * skew, multi-day offline partitions, and data-before-key-registration ordering, and asserts each
 * fact is present in every replica's admitted set after sync (a quarantined/untrusted fact still
 * counts as admitted)."
 *
 * RELATION TO THE FROZEN INV-13a (./inv-13a.test.ts — NOT touched): the a-form asserts admitted-on-
 * receipt at the GATE with NO trust states ("quarantine/untrusted labels are M8 machinery, gated by
 * the full INV-13"). This file adds the M8 half: a fact that proj DEMOTES (unregistered key) is
 * STILL a member — admission is preserved for the very facts trust demotes, which is what makes the
 * SEC antecedent (equal admitted sets) non-vacuous. No assertion duplicates INV-13a's gate cases.
 *
 * EXPECTED TO FAIL NOW: the membership half already holds (byte-pure gate) — the genuine-failure
 * anchor is the CONJUNCTION "admitted AND demoted" (the demotion half does not exist yet, so the
 * fact is admitted-AND-trusted, failing the demotion assertion). Failures are assertion mismatches,
 * never type/import errors.
