/**
 * INV-9 — GC / excision safety (M3's exit gate is the EXCISION HALF only).
 *
 * docs/60-conformance-and-testability.md#inv-9 (verbatim): "Asserts: gc / repack / rollup never
 * change query results for any non-excised `asOf`; excision changes results only for the excised
 * CID (returning an `"excised"` placeholder) and re-folds dependent heads. Class:
 * result-stability. Violation: gc altering a non-excised result, or excision residue surviving in
 * `/heads`."
 *
 * Scope note (docs/80-roadmap-and-milestones.md / docs/81-roadmap-epics-and-tasks.md, verbatim):
 * the roadmap table names INV-9 for M3 as "(excision half)" only (line "M3 sync + convergence +
 * regen ... INV-2a, 9 (excision half), 12, 13a, 14"). T13.3 ("Rollup & read-latency snapshots")
 * and T13.4 ("Packing & GC of unreachable objects") each explicitly say their own exit criterion
 * "carries the rollup half"/"the gc/repack half of INV-9 deferred out of M3's excision-half gate" —
 * i.e. the roadmap ITSELF states the gc/repack result-stability clause is NOT M3's responsibility to
 * prove; it gates the later E13 tooling epic instead. This file therefore exercises the excision half
 * in full (see the two `it` blocks below) and marks ONLY the gc/repack half `it.skip` with its exact
 * deferral reason. ROUND-2 re-audit correction: the ROLLUP half is no longer deferred — `rollup()` is
 * implemented (kip-repo.ts) and its result-stability ("rollup never changes a non-excised asOf result")
 * is covered by the sibling inv-9-m3-surface.test.ts; the `it.skip` below is now scoped to the gc/repack
 * half alone, whose enabling method still does not exist on the public surface.
 *
 * docs/24-synchronization-and-convergence.md §4.5 (condensed, verbatim clauses this file drives):
 * "Excision re-runs `proj` over the remaining set and rewrites `/heads` so no residue of the
 * excised value survives ... A head that folded in the excised value is recomputed; if a cell
 * loses its only covering assert it becomes `unknown`." / "Reads that would resolve through an
 * excised fact return a typed `"excised"` placeholder segment ... never silently fabricated
 * data." These are two DISTINCT observable surfaces — a plain (no-`asOf`) LIVE re-fold vs. a
 * historical `asOf({validTime})` read through the erased fact's original interval — and this file
 * exercises both separately, matching the spec's own two-clause structure exactly rather than
 * collapsing them into one assertion.
 *
 * Public-surface note: `CellSegment`'s `"excised"` variant did not exist on index.ts's public
 * surface before this round (only `"value" | "unknown" | "conflict" | "quarantine"` did) — a
 * MINIMAL, additive typed variant was added there (mirroring the established precedent of the
 * `"quarantine"` variant, itself added ahead of its producing code path for INV-8) purely so this
 * file's asOf-through-excision assertion type-checks against the shape the spec text names; no
 * behavior/logic was added, and no other file's meaning changed.
 *
 * `excise()` currently throws `unimplemented: excise` (M3/T4.6 not yet implemented) — these tests
 * are EXPECTED TO FAIL right now; failures should surface as the thrown `unimplemented` error
 * propagating through the `await`, not as import/type errors. The fact-ingestion steps that
 * PRECEDE each `excise()` call are real, already-implemented M0-M2 machinery and genuinely execute
 * today.
