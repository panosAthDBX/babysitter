/**
 * INV-4 — belief-consistency (per-replica AUDIT; renamed from "bitemporal soundness", M2-4).
 *
 * docs/60-conformance-and-testability.md#inv-4 (verbatim): "Asserts: projected segments of any
 * cell are non-overlapping at every rxTime slice; gaps read as Unknown. asOf({txTime,
 * believer=R}) agrees with a per-replica reference oracle built from R's ingest order. This is a
 * belief-audit invariant, explicitly NOT a convergence claim (txTime is replica-local). Class:
 * per-replica audit (not cross-replica byte-identity). Violation: overlapping segments at a
 * slice, or asOf(txTime) disagreeing with R's oracle."
 *
 * Roadmap scope (docs/81-roadmap-epics-and-tasks.md): T3.2 ("asOf reads (valid-time lens & belief
 * lens)") is gated on INV-4 (and INV-11); T3.2.2/T3.2.3 name the txTime belief-audit lens and
 * "belief oracle agreement at every rxTime slice" directly. docs/23-temporality-and-bitemporality.md
 * §3/§2.1 and docs/25-context-enablement-seams.md corroborate: `asOf({txTime, believer})` "selects
 * the subset of S whose rxFrom (on R) ≤ T, then proj-folds that subset and filters by validTime"
 * — explicitly per-replica, resolved against "R's ingest order", never a cross-replica claim.
 *
 * SCOPE NOTE (single replica, no sync — M2/M0-M2 machinery only): "believer" in these tests is
 * always the SAME, single `KipRepo` instance that performed the ingests (the local replica), per
 * `AsOf.believer`'s own doc comment ("default = the local replica", index.ts). A genuinely
 * DIFFERENT replica's belief cannot be audited without first syncing its facts in (M3's `sync`),
 * so cross-replica belief-audit scenarios are out of scope here, matching INV-14a's own
 * single-replica framing for the sibling M2 exit invariant.
 *
 * OBSERVABILITY GAP (documented, not weakened — see the `it.skip` below and this task's
 * `untestable` report): `rxFrom` is "RECEIVER-assigned ... at first verified ingest" and recorded
 * ONLY in `FactAnnotation` (docs/23 §1) — index.ts's `Repo`/`KipRepo`/`OpenOptions` public surface
 * exposes NO seam to read back, inject, or otherwise discover the actual `rxFrom` stamp a
 * specific ingested fact received. The one `rxTime` cut that IS reachable through the public
 * surface without inventing a new API method is "the current frontier as of the last ingest" —
 * modeled here as a txTime cut fixed at a maximal sentinel `HlcStamp`
 * (`{wall: Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, counter: 0, replicaId}`), which — because `rxFrom` is "strictly
 * monotone in this replica's own ingest order" (docs/23 §2) and therefore bounded above by any
 * value this large — is guaranteed to be `>=` every fact's real `rxFrom` on this replica, i.e. it
 * denotes exactly "R's belief right now". This lets the tests below exercise the FULL claim at the
 * one rxTime slice reachable black-box (the current frontier, re-checked at every point in R's own
 * ingest history — literally "at every [reachable] rxTime slice"), while the genuinely-past,
 * arbitrary-cut half of the claim (pinpointing "R's belief as of some STRICTLY EARLIER historical
 * instant, chosen without having witnessed rxFrom directly") is marked untestable, mirroring
 * inv-1.test.ts's own documented `rxFrom`-seam gap for INV-1.
 *
 * `asOf(...)` currently throws `unimplemented: asOf` (M2/T3.2 not yet implemented) — these tests
 * are EXPECTED TO FAIL right now; failures should surface as the thrown `unimplemented` error
 * propagating through the `await`, not as import/type errors (the same convention every M0/M1
 * conformance file in this directory already follows).
