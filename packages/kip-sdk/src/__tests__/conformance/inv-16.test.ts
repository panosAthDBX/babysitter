/**
 * INV-16 — per-key anti-backdating from INVOLUNTARY footprint, GATED ON CHAIN COMPLETENESS
 * (C4-2 + C5-1, m5-5).
 *
 * docs/60-conformance-and-testability.md#inv-16 (verbatim core): "a signature-valid fact `F` from key
 * `K` projects TRUSTED only over a complete gap-free chain of `K` up to `F` … and once complete is
 * demoted `untrusted-anachronistic` iff `S` holds a higher-author-HLC, non-ancestor fact from the
 * SAME `K` IN THE COMPLETE DURABLE CHAIN — independent of whether `F` declares `causedBy`. Sub-cases:
 * (C4-2) author a registered, non-revoked key's higher-stamped fact, then a `causedBy`-LESS backdated
 * fact from the same key → the backdate is demoted (NOT trusted). (genuine residual) a lone self-dated
 * fact from a key that genuinely emitted nothing higher in its chain → projects TRUSTED."
 *
 * The signing key is AUTHORIZED (KeyAuthorization chaining to a genesis root) so a demotion is
 * attributable to anti-backdating, not to absent authorization. An AUTHORIZED SEEDER supplies the
 * node-existence fact so a demoted prop is observed against a PRESENT node (non-vacuous). The chain
 * order (seq) is: higher-stamped fact at the LOWER seq, backdate at the HIGHER seq — the backdate is
 * authored later (higher seq) yet stamped earlier (lower author-HLC), the involuntary-footprint
 * violation. NOTE the modeled KeyAuthorization carrier (fixtures-m8.ts #2).
 *
 * COVERAGE NOTE (C5-1 eviction sub-case): the "higher same-key fact present-but-EVICTED ⇒ backdate
 * PENDING" sub-case needs the §3.5a retention/eviction machinery, which is NOT reachable through the
 * public `Repo` surface (no `RetentionClass`, no eviction seam) — see this suite's `untestable`
 * report and INV-19 (which covers the equivalent chain-gap via partial-replication delivery order).
 *
 * EXPECTED TO FAIL NOW: no per-key anti-backdating exists — a same-key backdate projects a trusted
 * value today. Failures are assertion mismatches, never type/import errors.
