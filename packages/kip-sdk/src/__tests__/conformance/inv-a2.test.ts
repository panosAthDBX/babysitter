/**
 * INV-A2 — compile-determinism + DAG order.
 *
 * docs/60-conformance-and-testability.md#inv-a2 (verbatim): "Asserts: Two replicas compiling the
 * same ContextualQuery at the same asOf produce byte-identical Segment sets (steps + deps + ordered
 * alternatives), under perturbed sync state / key-log order / wall clock; a branching deps DAG
 * yields a byte-identical TOPOLOGICAL order (ties: ascending steps[] index then §3.4 tiebreak); a
 * cyclic or out-of-range deps is rejected at compile. Violating build: compile reading replica-local
 * sync state or a wall clock; replica-dependent topo order; admitting a cyclic deps."
 *
 * docs/31-contextual-functionalities.md's "Phase 1 — Compile + match" section: "Two replicas at the
 * same asOf MUST compile the byte-identical segment set (INV-A2)"; and "Composition — the patent's
 * combine-relations technique": "for every adjacent pair, steps[i].targetKind MUST equal (or be an
 * is_a supertype-compatible match of) steps[i+1].sourceKind; a Segment violating this is ill-typed
 * and MUST NOT be compiled or surfaced" (ERR_ILL_TYPED_SEGMENT, docs/40's Errors table).
 *
 * Test methodology — "two replicas" is realized as two independent `KipRepo` instances that
 * register the SAME set of `FunctionalityBinding`s via the real `registerFunctionality` seam, in
 * OPPOSITE call order (the closest honest proxy for "perturbed... key-log order" reachable through
 * the public surface alone, without hand-forging the internal registration-fact bytes
 * `registerFunctionality` itself is responsible for minting — see fixtures-m5.ts's own doc comment).
 * `compileContextualQuery`/`registerFunctionality` still throw `unimplemented: <name>` (M5/T6.1-T6.2
 * not yet implemented) — these tests are EXPECTED TO FAIL right now via that thrown error
 * propagating through the `await`, per this suite's established convention (see inv-14a.test.ts).
