/**
 * INV-19 — anti-backdating preserved under eviction & partial replication (C5-1; holds under
 * cap-bounded retention, M6-1/m6-2).
 *
 * docs/60-conformance-and-testability.md#inv-19 (verbatim core): "per-key trust is monotone and
 * eviction-safe. The suite (1) authors `K`'s higher honest fact `F'` and a lower backdate `F` from
 * the same registered `K`; (2) on a victim replica induces eviction / non-replication of `F'`; (3)
 * asserts the victim projects `F` PENDING (chain gap), NEVER trusted; (4) re-fetches/delivers `F'`
 * (and the intervening chain) and asserts `F` flips to demoted (`untrusted-anachronistic`), at most
 * once and never reversing."
 *
 * OBSERVABLE SUBSET DRIVEN HERE — PARTIAL REPLICATION via DELIVERY ORDER: the public `Repo` surface
 * has no §3.5a eviction/`RetentionClass`/re-fetch seam, so the CAP-EVICTION route (evict `F'` past
 * `keyChainDurableCapBytes`, then re-fetch) is NOT reachable and is recorded in this suite's
 * `untestable` report. The set-pure CORE of INV-19 — "a missing lower chain link forces the dependent
 * PENDING, never trusted; delivering it flips to demoted, never trusted" — IS reachable by delivering
 * the same-key backdate BEFORE its lower chain link (a partial-replication state). The signing key is
 * AUTHORIZED and an AUTHORIZED SEEDER supplies node-existence, so (non-)trust is attributable to the
 * chain/anti-backdating rule and observed against a PRESENT node (fixtures-m8.ts #2).
 *
 * EXPECTED TO FAIL NOW: no chain-gap `pending` and no per-key anti-backdating exist — the backdate
 * projects a trusted value at every point today. Failures are assertion mismatches, never type/import
 * errors.
