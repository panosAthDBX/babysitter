/**
 * INV-13a — admitted-on-receipt gate sub-case (M0's exit gate), re-driven at the M3 boundary
 * through the `merge()` + `subscribe()` SURFACE METHODS (the receipt paths M3 adds beyond raw
 * `ingest()`).
 *
 * docs/60-conformance-and-testability.md#inv-13a (verbatim): "Asserts: every signature-valid fact
 * offered to a replica is admitted on receipt — written to `/facts/**` and never dropped —
 * including facts with arbitrarily old/skewed author-HLCs and facts whose signing key the replica
 * has never seen (assert on `/facts` presence + INV-7 idempotent re-offer, not on projected trust)."
 * docs/24-synchronization-and-convergence.md §4.6 (verbatim): "because signature-valid facts are
 * never dropped (admission is signature-only, §3.2), an offline replica that reconnects after an
 * arbitrarily long partition has all its locally-authored facts accepted by every peer".
 *
 * Non-overlap with the frozen ./inv-13a.test.ts: that file drives `ingest()` directly and asserts
 * the `{ admitted: true }` gate verdict + idempotent re-offer. THIS file asserts the SAME
 * admitted-on-receipt guarantee as it manifests through the two M3 receipt seams — `merge()` (which
 * unions a branch's facts, admitting each on receipt) and `subscribe()` (the frontier cursor that
 * SURFACES each admitted fact as a `FactDelta`). No assertion here duplicates the direct-ingest
 * gate-verdict assertions there.
 *
 * `merge()` throws `unimplemented: merge` and `subscribe()` throws `unimplemented: subscribe`
 * (index.ts) — these tests are EXPECTED TO FAIL now; the failure surfaces as the thrown
 * `unimplemented` propagating through the `await`/`for await`, never an import/type error. The
 * pre-driver `ingest()` setup is real M0–M2 machinery.
