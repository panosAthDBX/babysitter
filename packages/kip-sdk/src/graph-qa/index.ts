/**
 * graph-QA microagent — the READ-ONLY retrieval→synthesis core (design: kip-graph-qa.md).
 *
 * `answerQuestion` is the pure-ish core the bundled `kip-graph-qa.mjs` entrypoint (and the `kip ask`
 * CLI / `kip_ask` MCP call sites) dispatch to: it turns a natural-language `question` into a grounded
 * NL `answer` with per-claim citations back to signed `FactId`s, using ONLY the kip read seams
 * (`recall`/`query`/`asOf`/`getNode`/`getEdge`/`provenanceOf`). It authors NOTHING (INV-A1) and
 * abstains rather than fabricates (N5).
 *
 * The single non-deterministic, accelerator-class step — prompting `runtime.model` to write the prose
 * and pick per-claim citations (kip-graph-qa.md §3.3) — is INJECTED as `synthesize`, mirroring the
 * accelerator boundary (§5.3): the retrieval half is a deterministic function of the as-of fact set,
 * while the model call lives outside `proj`. The frozen acceptance suite injects a deterministic
 * scripted synthesizer so the pipeline is byte-testable while the model boundary stays
 * recall-/citation-based.
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: `answerQuestion` is FULLY IMPLEMENTED — it runs the real, read-only
 * retrieval→assembly→citation-binding pipeline end-to-end (validate input → `recall` seed → bounded
 * typed `query` expansion → `getNode`/`getEdge` hydration with per-datum `FactId` binding → abstain
 * on empty retrieval → injected `synthesize` → drop hallucinated citations). The ONLY thing it does
 * NOT ship in-process is the model call itself: that is the caller-injected `synthesize` seam, which
 * remains the primary override (and is what the deterministic suites inject). The PRODUCTION default
 * binds `harnessCliSynthesize` (`src/cli/ask.ts`, ADR-B8): it spawns the already-authenticated local
 * `claude` CLI via `node:child_process` — a Node builtin, so no dependency crosses this boundary. When
 * no model is available (binary absent/unauthenticated) or the contract deviates, the answer path
 * still fails LOUD on the dispatch-failure channel (exit 5 / `ERR_ASK_DISPATCH_FAILED`), never
 * fabricating (N5). All 15 §8 acceptance criteria are covered by `src/__tests__/graph-qa.test.ts`;
 * the production seam is covered by `src/__tests__/graph-qa-live.test.ts`.

 *
 * THE GAP. After `kip link` (`src/linker/entity-linker.ts`) authors a `documents` edge from a `doc:`
 * concept node to its `code:module` node, a `kip ask` whose answer rests on that concept cited the
 * CONCEPT side only. The linked `code:module` node's props are `content`(blob)/`format`/`linesOfCode`
 * — no question-lexical text — so the accelerator-class synthesizer never picks it over the concept
 * facts that DO match the question. The graph is unified and traversable (the depth-3 both-direction
 * traversal already crosses the `documents` edge and both the edge fact AND the code node's props are
 * in `usedFacts`), but the provenance under-served the code side.
 *
 * THE FIX, AND WHY IT LIVES HERE (post-`bindAndValidateCitations`, NOT in the synthesis context).
 * Injecting a "code:module X implements this" datum into the synthesis context would leave the CITATION
 * up to the model — and the model's failure to cite the code node (no question-lexical text) is the
 * whole defect, so that path stays model-dependent. Binding the linkage AFTER citation binding makes it
 * DETERMINISTIC: for every concept the answer GENUINELY cites (a bound citation whose subject `eid` is a
 * `doc:` concept), if a `documents` edge in the ALREADY-RETRIEVED fact set connects it to a `code:*`
 * node, add ONE linked-evidence citation naming that code node, bound to the `documents` edge's REAL
 * signed `factId` (already an element of `usedFacts` — the edge-existence fact recorded in step 3).
 *
 * HONESTY / N5. A code citation is added ONLY when a real `documents` edge in the retrieved set connects
 * the code node to a concept that is genuinely in the answer's used evidence — never for a code node no
 * cited concept documents, never for an edge kind other than `documents`, never a fabricated `factId`.
 * The citation is "what the used concept documents": its `eid` is the real `to` of the edge and its
 * `factId` is the edge's real existence fact, so every field is substrate-derived (it is NOT routed back
 * through the model-facing rebinder because it is not model output — it is a deterministic function of
 * the retrieved edge set). It is bounded by the retrieved node/edge set (fetches no new node/edge, widens
 * no traversal), read-only (authors nothing, INV-A1), and it runs only on the non-abstaining return
 * path, so the abstention contract (empty citations on abstain) is untouched.
 *
 * MODEL-DEPENDENCE RESIDUAL (honest): whether the answer PROSE names the file is still the model's; this
 * only guarantees the `code:*` node's linkage FACT is in the citable evidence set deterministically.
