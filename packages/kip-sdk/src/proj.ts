/**
 * proj.ts — M1's core mechanism (SPEC.md §3.4, docs/24-synchronization-and-convergence.md §1/§3):
 * the deterministic, set-pure whole-set fold `proj(S)` that materializes `/heads` (here: in-memory
 * `NodeView`/`EdgeView` projections) from the admitted fact SET. Implements the WBS pipeline in
 * dependency order:
 *
 *   T2.1 orderKey (a deterministic ordering over set-resident fields, ending in
 *        publicKeyFingerprint then factCID; NOT a genuine total order over content — see
 *        `compareOrderKey`'s doc comment for why a `factCID` tie is possible and how callers that
 *        need full determinism close it) ->
 *   T2.2 the fold pipeline (sort by orderKey -> group by cell -> upcast -> reduce; a pure,
 *        whole-set function, never a pairwise/binary merge) ->
 *   T2.3 cell reducers (the DEFAULT `lww-hlc` sweep: at each elementary valid-time sub-interval,
 *        the orderKey-max covering assert wins) ->
 *   T2.4 versioned upcasters (M1 scope note below) ->
 *   T2.5 interval geometry (non-overlapping segments; gaps are first-class `unknown`;
 *        existence-gates-properties, no ghost nodes) ->
 *   T2.6 conflict surfacing (`kip:conflict` for non-commutative contradictory `supersede` facts,
 *        never a silent orderKey/hash tiebreak) ->
 *   T2.7 the read surface `getNode`/`getEdge`/typed traversal that `index.ts`'s `KipRepo` calls.
 *
 * T2.4 (versioned upcasters) SCOPE NOTE: SPEC.md §2.2 defines upcasting against a per-tenant
 * ONTOLOGY (`NodeKindDef.version` + declarative upcasters keyed on it). `index.ts`'s `Repo` surface
 * still exposes no ontology/schema-registration method (no `NodeKindDef`/`defineNodeKind`-shaped
 * API), so a real per-kind version comparison remains out of reach — the gap INV-8's own test file
 * documents ("SURFACE GAP", see also this task's `disputes`). What IS implemented: a fact's `v` is
 * not blindly passed through regardless of magnitude — `reduceRawCell` quarantines (a typed
 * `CellSegment{kind:"quarantine"}`, see index.ts) any fact whose `v` exceeds `proj()`'s configured
 * `knownMaxVersion` (default `1`) instead of trusting its `value`, the honest "unknown versions
 * pass through as opaque-quarantined" half of INV-8's never-throw/never-fabricate contract.
 * `KipRepo`'s constructor threads a `knownMaxVersion` option through every `getNode`/`getEdge`/
 * `query` call (index.ts) so this threshold is configurable end-to-end, not just a `proj()`-internal
 * default.
 *
 * T2.3 SCOPE NOTE: `gsetReducer`/`pncounterReducer` (cell-reducers.ts) are real, unit-tested cell
 * reducers, reachable end-to-end via `getNode`/`getEdge`'s `reduceCellByRef`, which dispatches every
 * node-prop/edge-prop cell through a caller-supplied `cellReducers` association
 * (`ProjOptions.cellReducers`, threaded from `KipRepo`'s own constructor option, see index.ts) and
 * falls back to the DEFAULT `lww-hlc` sweep (`reduceRawCell`, still existence-gating/conflict-
 * surfacing/quarantine-aware) when no association names a cell. This is still SHORT of a full
 * per-`NodeKindDef`/`EdgeKindDef` ontology-driven registration surface (the gap inv-3.test.ts's and
 * inv-7.test.ts's own `it.skip` blocks document remains genuinely unimplemented — those frozen
 * tests still cannot SELECT a reducer without a schema-registration API, see disputes) — but
 * `CellReducerAssociations` is a real, minimal, directly end-to-end-testable seam rather than only
 * unit-testable in isolation.

 *     of the removed CID", with the marker itself carrying its own salt so no separate genesis-
 *     shared-secret machinery is needed.
 *   - `origFingerprint`: the ERASED fact's OWN signer fingerprint, embedded so ANY replica —
 *     including one that never held the original bytes — can verify "is this marker's OWN signer
 *     authorized to erase THIS specific author's data" (self-excision) purely from the admitted
 *     set, with no per-replica side-channel. NOTE: `collectExcisions` never authorizes off this
 *     self-declared field alone when a real candidate is still present — see its own doc comment.
 *   - `cellTarget`/`validFrom`/`validTo`: the erased fact's own cell target + valid-time interval,
 *     embedded so ANY replica admitting this marker — not just the one that physically erased the
 *     bytes — can reconstruct the identical `"excised"` placeholder geometry (`excisionsByCell` is
 *     a pure function of `facts` alone, exactly like `excisedOids`).
 *   - `excisedFactId` (DOCUMENTED, DELIBERATE EXCEPTION): the erased fact's caller-DECLARED id,
 *     kept for `CellSegment{kind:"excised"}.excisedFactId` display purposes ONLY — never consulted
 *     by the exclusion-matching (`ref`/`nonce` alone drive that) or authorization logic. This is in
 *     tension with C-4.3's "never a stable fingerprint of the erased content", but INV-9's own
 *     FROZEN assertion requires the EXACT original declared id to be reproducible even in the
 *     single-replica, bytes-durably-gone scenario (no candidate fact left anywhere to derive it
 *     from), and any replica — not just the excising one — must reconstruct an identical
 *     placeholder, which is impossible without some durable, convergent carrier of this value. See
 *     this task's `disputes` output / reviews/build-final-report.md for the full reasoning; the
 *     security-relevant matching/authorization decisions never depend on this field.
 *   - `excisedReason`: the excise() caller's own validated `reason` string (`"fork" | "malformed" |
 *     "gdpr-erasure" | "other"`, index.ts's `ALLOWED_REASONS`), embedded in the SIGNED, durable,
 *     synced marker payload. OPTIONAL (never required for a marker to parse/be honored) so a
 *     marker that omits it is still parsed and honored exactly as before — this field is
 *     display/audit-only, never consulted by matching (`ref`/`nonce`) or authorization logic.

 *      verified (at ITS OWN `excise()` mint time, against the real candidate it held then — never

 * sourcing them locally is sound. But `excisedReason` is different in kind: it is a caller-SUPPLIED

 *
 * This is the SAME "multiple candidates, need one pure-content pick" problem `maxByOrderKey`/

 * parsed `excisedReason` — never the local record's — is what gets projected.
 *
 * Condition (c) is load-bearing, not incidental: without it, an admitted-but-UNREGISTERED
 * (placeholder-signature-fallback, see `isPlaceholderSignature`) marker — which requires no real
 * signing key, only knowledge of the target oid, to craft a `ref` match — could inject an arbitrary

 * would let a legitimate excision reach, while still excluding any placeholder-signed forgery.
