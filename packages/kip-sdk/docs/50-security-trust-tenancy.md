# Security, trust & tenancy

> PKI-style trust (root-of-trust → scoped delegation → revocation), multi-tenant scoping, privacy/redaction/erasure, auditability, and the resource-exhaustion/DoS threat model — all expressed as **set-pure `proj` decisions** keyed on author-HLC, never as ingest-time value rejections.

**Source:** SPEC §8.1–§8.3b (root-of-trust/scoped-authority/revocation, tenancy, privacy, auditability, DoS). Cross-cuts §3.2 (signature-only gate), §3.4/§3.6 (set-pure `proj`), §3.5a (admission control & retention), §4.5 (forgetting), §4b.4 (SEC).

## 0. The bright line

kip has **exactly one** membership predicate — a fact is admitted **iff** it is well-formed and its
Ed25519 signature verifies over its canonical payload (§3.2, the [convergence core](./24-synchronization-and-convergence.md)). **Everything else in this document — key-registration, namespace authority, revocation, anti-backdating, scope — is a `proj`-time DEMOTION keyed on the fact's own signed AUTHOR-HLC, never an ingest gate.** A demoted fact is `untrusted`/`quarantined`/`pending`, never silently dropped (N5) and never silently trusted; it is re-evaluated monotonically as more facts arrive. Because every demotion reads only set-resident quantities, two replicas holding the same admitted set make byte-identical trust decisions.

## 8.1 Trust model — root of trust, scoped authority, revocation (C-6)

The trust set is **not** a flat, freely-writable global ref. kip defines a real PKI-style model.

### Root of trust (C-6.4)

- Each tenant has a **genesis root key set** pinned in the immutable `manifest.json`, established at repo creation and **never edited thereafter** (m2-5/M2-3).
- **Key-authorization and revocation facts have exactly ONE home (m7-5): they are ordinary facts in `/facts/**`** (`type:"assert"`/`"revoke-key"`, `target:{kind:"key"}`) — signed, gated, synced, and folded like every other fact, read by `proj` from `/facts` **only**. The ref `refs/kip/keys/<tenant>/trusted` is a **derived, regenerable local INDEX** over those facts ([git substrate §1.1](./22-git-substrate.md)): never authoritative, never synced, droppable at any time. A key-authorization fact is **valid (trusted by `proj`) only if its *authorizing* key chains, at the key-add fact's author-HLC, to the genesis root** for that namespace. A key-add whose chain does not reach the genesis root is **demoted-untrusted by `proj`** (set-pure, author-HLC keyed) — so a key authorizing a forger key never *grants* authority, identically on every replica.
- A fact signed by an **unregistered** key (no set-resident `KeyAuthorization` chaining to the genesis root at the fact's author-HLC) is **NOT rejected at ingest**; it is **admitted by signature alone** and **demoted `untrusted`/`quarantined` by `proj`** (M3-4), becoming trusted automatically if/when a valid registration for that key arrives — so a data-fact racing ahead of its key's registration is never lost.
- A replica that can merely `push` therefore **cannot self-authorize forgery**: its key-add is admitted to the set but folds to *no authority*. The genesis root set is permanent (manifest-frozen); routine **rotation** moves *current* signing authority along the chain without ever touching the genesis root. **Rotation SHOULD retire the old key explicitly (m7-11):** pair the new `KeyAuthorization` with an **`ordinary-cutoff` `revoke-key` on the old fingerprint, `effectiveFrom` = the handover author-HLC** — preserving all pre-handover history as trusted (M2-3) while retiring forward authority. A rotation that only authorizes the new key leaves the old key **trusted indefinitely** (a stolen "rotated-away" key could still mint trusted facts); INV-17 exercises the paired flow.

### Genesis-root compromise — honest bound and the re-genesis path (m7-12, R7)

Revocation chains terminate at the genesis root, so **no in-band mechanism can revoke the root
itself**: an attacker holding a genesis root key can mint `KeyAuthorization`s and counter-revocations
indefinitely, and no honest fact out-demotes it. This is intrinsic to a manifest-frozen root and is an
**accepted residual ([R7](./90-open-questions.md))** with an explicit **out-of-band recovery path —
re-genesis**: create a new repo/manifest with a fresh root set; migrate by having keys authorized under
the new root **re-attest / re-import** the old repo's still-wanted facts (the m5-3 `re-attest`
primitive and/or the Ingestor path — old signatures stay historically verifiable; trust is re-derived
under the new root); record the old repo's tip `factSetDigest` in the new genesis metadata for audit
continuity. Mitigations (SHOULD): offline, split-custody root keys used **only** to delegate; delegate
day-to-day authority to revocable keys immediately after genesis.

### Scoped authority (C-6.3, C-5, M3-1)

A key authorization binds `key → { namespaces; ops }`. A key may write only EIDs in its authorized namespaces (the C-5 write-authority binding); `excise`/`revoke`/`resolve` are **separately scoped capabilities** (a write key cannot excise, revoke, or adjudicate conflicts). `resolve` is the **single-writer adjudication scope** that lets a key author a *dominating* `supersede` clearing a `kip:conflict` (§3.4, M3-1) — so contradictory concurrent resolutions cannot both be authoritative. Multi-tenant isolation is **structural**: a tenant-A key is never an authority for a tenant-B namespace. `excise-evidence` is a further-separately-scoped capability: an `excise()` call whose target fact carries a fork- or well-formedness-demotion status (SPEC.md §4.5, §4b.1, R11) requires the excising key's `KeyAuthorization.ops` to include `excise-evidence`; lacking it, the excision is rejected with `ERR_EXCISE_EVIDENCE_REQUIRED` (docs/40 "Errors") rather than silently downgraded to an ordinary excision — enforced as a `proj`-time authorization check, the same set-pure mechanism as every other scoped-authority question here.

#### Normative interfaces (carried over verbatim)

```ts
interface KeyAuthorization {                 // recorded as a signed fact, target.kind === "key"
  keyFpr: string;                            // SHA-256 of the authorized pubkey
  namespaces: string[];                      // STABLE namespaceIds this key may write (M2-3); authority transfers across keys for a FIXED namespace
  ops: ("write" | "delegate" | "excise" | "revoke" | "resolve" | "excise-evidence")[]; // resolve = single-writer conflict adjudication (M3-1)
  authorizedBy: string;                      // fingerprint of the delegating key (chains to genesis root)
  effectiveFrom: HlcStamp;                   // AUTHOR-HLC: a fact is authorized iff its author-HLC ≥ this and < any later revocation (set-pure, proj decision)
}
interface KeyRevocation {                    // type:"revoke-key" fact; demotes, does not delete (N5)
  keyFpr: string;
  effectiveFrom: HlcStamp;                   // AUTHOR-HLC (M2-5, C2-1): trust cutoff. Compared to author-HLC, NEVER to receiver rxFrom.
  mode: "ordinary-cutoff" | "causal-cutoff"; // REVOKER INTENT (M4-1). Default SHOULD be "ordinary-cutoff".
  reason: string;
  revokedBy: string;                         // must hold `revoke` scope (chains to genesis root)
}
```

**Key invariants:**
- A `KeyAuthorization` MUST chain to the genesis root at the **key-add fact's** author-HLC, else `proj` demotes it.
- `effectiveFrom` is in **author-HLC space** and is compared **only** to author-HLCs in `S` — **never** to a receiver `rxFrom` or physical clock.
- `namespaceId` is a **frozen genesis fingerprint** (M2-3): rotating `Kfpr1 → Kfpr2` is a `KeyAuthorization` granting `Kfpr2` `write` over the *same* namespace; the EID never changes, the namespace is never orphaned (§3.6, [data model](./21-data-model.md)).

### Revocation — a SET-PURE `proj` decision on AUTHOR-HLC, with revoker-chosen intent (C-6.1, C2-1, M2-5, C3-3, M4-1)

Key compromise is recoverable **without rewriting history**. A signed `revoke-key` fact carries `effectiveFrom` (author-HLC) and a `mode`:

| Mode | Demotes | Honest-concurrent cost | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`ordinary-cutoff`** (SAFE DEFAULT) | facts with own author-HLC ≥ `effectiveFrom` | **none** — preserves honest concurrent pre-`effectiveFrom` work | suspected misuse-going-forward |
| **`causal-cutoff`** (OPT-IN) | also facts **not** a causal ancestor of the `revoke-key` fact (via the set-resident `causedBy` closure, §4b.1) | demotes honest concurrent work too | genuine key **COMPROMISE** (closes the ε-width sub-`effectiveFrom` backdating band, C3-3) |

- The revoker MUST choose `causal-cutoff` **deliberately**; it is never the default. A `causal-cutoff` revoke SHOULD stamp `causedBy` to pin the exact causal frontier observed at revocation time.
- **Honest-loss cost (M4-1), stated explicitly.** `causal-cutoff` cannot distinguish a malicious concurrent backdate from an honest concurrent write — both are "past-stamped, non-ancestor-of-the-revocation." It therefore demotes honest concurrent authorship that the revoker had not yet observed; the loss is proportional to partition/propagation delay.
- Honest-concurrent casualties of `causal-cutoff` carry a **DISTINCT** projected status **`kip:revoked-concurrent`** (NOT the generic `untrusted` bucket), so a reader/operator can SEE them in `recall` and re-adjudicate via a **`re-attest` fact** (below) rather than the value silently vanishing from `/heads` (N5). Facts demoted by author-HLC ≥ `effectiveFrom` carry the ordinary `untrusted` status.
- Both modes compare **only set-resident** quantities (author-HLCs and the signed `causedBy` closure, all in `S`), so the demotion is **byte-identical across replicas** (C2-1/C3-3). Pre-`effectiveFrom` facts the revoker **causally observed remain trusted forever** under both modes — revocation never retroactively invalidates honest facts in its ancestry (M2-3), so key rotation is safe.

**Impossibility (M5-2), stated honestly.** No **set-pure** revocation mode can simultaneously (a) demote a compromised key's **sub-`effectiveFrom` backdates** and (b) **preserve that key's honest concurrent sub-`effectiveFrom` work** — both are set-indistinguishable. The two modes are the two horns of this impossibility, shipped as an explicit tradeoff, not a defect. `ordinary-cutoff` chooses (b); `causal-cutoff` chooses (a). (See [open questions R2](./90-open-questions.md).)

### Backdating defense — a SET-RESIDENT CAUSAL rule inside `proj`, NOT any clock gate (C-6.2, C2-1, C3-1, C3-3, C4-2, C5-1)

Every clock is removed from the defense. `proj` decides backdating by set-resident rules, in this order:

1. **PRIMARY — per-key author-HLC monotonicity, GATED ON CHAIN COMPLETENESS (§3.6, §4b.1, C4-2 + C5-1).** A fact `F` from key `K` projects **trusted** only over a **complete, gap-free `seq` chain of `K` up to `F`** (the §4c/m4-1 contiguity rule). If a lower same-key fact is missing/evicted/unreplicated, `F` is **`pending`** (not trusted, not rejected) until the chain completes (C5-1). Once complete, `F` is demoted `untrusted-anachronistic` iff `S` holds a **higher-author-HLC, non-ancestor** fact from the **same** `K` in that complete chain. This reads `K`'s *involuntary* footprint, so it is **not evadable by omitting `causedBy`** (C4-2) nor by inducing eviction (the gap forces `pending`).
2. **SECONDARY (tightening only) — voluntary `causedBy` plausibility.** When `F` declares `causedBy`, its author-HLC must also dominate its declared ancestry's author-HLCs. Reads an author-controlled field; never relied on alone.
3. **`causedBy` well-formedness (M4-2).** A forward (`parent > child`) or cyclic `causedBy` edge demotes the fact `untrusted-malformed`, keeping the closure acyclic/terminating (INV-15).
4. **Revocation cutoff** (above, M4-1).

All rules compare **only** set-resident author-HLCs and set-resident ancestry; **no receiver clock, no `rxFrom`, no membership decision** is involved. Membership (signature only) and `proj` (value + trust) never share a clock space.

**Precise bound (the over-strong claim is RETRACTED, C4-2; the eviction route is CLOSED, C5-1).** Anti-backdating holds **relative to the key's own observed activity in `K`'s complete durable chain**. A key whose retained chain contains a higher-stamped non-ancestor fact cannot insert a *trusted* lower-stamped fact; a replica missing part of `K`'s chain projects the candidate **`pending`**, never trusted. A key that has emitted **nothing higher** can still self-date a genuine *first-emission* fact freely — an **acknowledged, acceptable residual** ([R1](./90-open-questions.md)), NOT attacker-reachable by eviction (the chain-completeness gate is the *safety* mechanism; `key-chain-durable` retention is a *liveness* aid only, §3.5a/M6-1).

**Forward-dating — the mirror attack, analyzed (m7-13, R9).** A registered (or briefly-compromised) key stamping a **far-future author-HLC**: **(a) head capture** — the forged stamp wins every `lww-hlc` race on the cells it covers against later honest writes **until a revocation lands** (no set-pure rule can demote it pre-revocation: a future stamp contradicts no same-key history — the pre-revocation window is residual **[R9](./90-open-questions.md)**, per-cell, visible in provenance, never silent); **(b) self-wedging** — the forged stamp becomes the key's chain maximum, so the key's own subsequent honest facts project `untrusted-anachronistic` until recovery; **(c) recovery** — an **`ordinary-cutoff` `revoke-key` with `effectiveFrom` below the forged stamp** demotes every fact ≥ `effectiveFrom` **including all future-dated stamps** (forward-dating cannot outrun a ≥-cutoff); honest same-key casualties in the ≥-band are restored via **`re-attest`** under a fresh key. Bounded by revocation latency — the same bound-shape as the trusted-flood DoS (§8.3b) — and never unrecoverable.

**Preserved under eviction & partial replication (INV-18(c)/INV-19).** The per-key trust decision is **monotone** (`pending → trusted/demoted` exactly once, never reverses — the completed-chain frontier is pinned while any non-`pending` dependent relies on it, m6-2) and **eviction-safe** (no eviction can flip a same-key backdate to `trusted`). See [conformance INV-16/18/19](./60-conformance-and-testability.md).

### Re-adjudicating a `kip:revoked-concurrent` casualty — the `re-attest` mechanism (m5-3)

A `kip:revoked-concurrent` fact's **content** was honest but its **signing key is revoked**, so it cannot be un-demoted in place, and a `resolve`-scoped `supersede` (which adjudicates `kip:conflict`, §3.4/M3-1) is the **wrong** primitive — there is no contradiction to resolve, only a demoted-by-revocation value to **restore under a trusted key**. kip defines a **`re-attest` fact** (`type:"assert"` carrying `reAttests: FactId` = the demoted fact's CID, signed by a **currently-trusted, non-revoked key** holding `write` scope): `proj` projects the re-attested **content** as a normal trusted assert from the new key (ordered by the new key's author-HLC), so the honest value re-enters `/heads` with fresh, valid provenance while the original demoted fact stays verifiable in history (N5). `re-attest` is set-pure and convergent (it reads only `reAttests` + the new key's authorization in `S`).

---

## 8.2 Tenancy & scoping

- **Tenant = a path-scoped subtree + ontology + authority key-set** (kradle path-scoping). `ScopeRef` selects a namespace; `withScope` is a **client-side write guard + read filter** (C-5.3): the SDK refuses to *author* EIDs outside the scope's authorized namespaces, and reads are filtered to the scope.
- The authoritative *cross-replica* enforcement remains the **set-pure `proj` demotion** keyed on author-HLC (§3.6) — **never an ingest-time value rejection** — so an out-of-scope fact that nonetheless reaches the set is uniformly demoted **everywhere**, not kept on some replicas and dropped on others.
- Cross-tenant reads require explicit **`grant` facts**: a tenant-A key may *reference* tenant-B's frozen `namespaceId` but never *write* it (M2-3).
- **Access policy is data**: `allow`/`deny` facts over (scope, actor, capability), as-of-queryable and auditable. Reads outside policy return **nothing** (no partial leak) — **through the SDK read path only** (see the read extension below).

> **`withScope` is ADVISORY — for WRITES *and* READS (m4-5, extended m7-16).** The client-side guard is the *only* thing stopping an **honest** client from authoring out-of-scope/excess facts; an attacker simply does not run it. It is **NOT** a DoS or cross-replica enforcement control — the authoritative bound is the set-pure `proj` demotion (for *value*) plus §3.5a retention (for *bytes*). See §8.3b. **The READ side is equally advisory:** the read filter and the `allow`/`deny` policy facts are enforced in the SDK read path only — **any principal with git fetch access to a shared multi-tenant repo reads every tenant's fact blobs raw**, bypassing the SDK. "Multi-tenant isolation is structural" (§8.1) is true **for write authority only**. **Deployment requirement:** confidentiality across mutually-untrusting tenants REQUIRES per-tenant repos/remotes (transport-scoped fetch access) or author-side payload encryption; sharing one repo across such tenants leaks by construction. OQ-5's deferred federation transport inherits this consequence and MUST NOT be read as providing read isolation.

---

## 8.3 Privacy / secrets / redaction / erasure

- **Secret redaction on export** by key-name regex (adapters/tasks): `token|secret|password|…` cells are redacted **at read** for unprivileged scopes. This is a lightweight per-read form and does **not** rewrite history. **Honest residuals (m7-14) — redaction is a courtesy read filter, NOT a privacy guarantee:** (a) it is a *name-pattern heuristic with false negatives* — a secret under a non-matching key name, inside a value string, or in a `BlobRef` payload is never redacted; (b) the plaintext secret bytes are **signed, committed, and replicated to every replica** (including unregistered-key quarantine peers) regardless of read-time redaction. For real secrets the correct primitive is **not writing them into the substrate**, or **field-level encryption by the author before signing** (the ciphertext becomes the fact value).
- **`exportKeyring()` (D-32) is a caller-controlled secret-export operation.** `KipRepo.exportKeyring()` returns THIS replica's current Ed25519 signing identity — including the raw PRIVATE key, PKCS8-PEM-serialized — so a caller can persist it and restore the identical identity across a `close()`+`open()` cycle (docs/40's `OpenOptions.keyring`). The returned `privateKeyPem` is exactly the kind of secret this section's redaction guidance is about, with none of redaction's mitigations available: it is a raw credential handed directly to the caller, in the clear, outside the signed-fact substrate entirely — so it is **not** covered by the name-pattern redaction heuristic above, and there is no read-time filtering to fall back on. The caller MUST treat the return value as a secret credential: persist it via an OS keychain, a secrets manager, or an equivalent encrypted-at-rest store; never log it, telemetrize it, print it, or transmit it over an unencrypted channel. Losing control of an exported private key is equivalent to losing control of the signing key itself — anyone holding it can mint facts this replica's identity would trust.
- **Erasure** has two distinct mechanisms (§4.5, [temporality doc](./23-temporality-and-bitemporality.md)), with the strength/cost tradeoff stated plainly:
  - **Tombstone (logical, signature-preserving)** — a signed `tombstone`/`retract` closes/splits valid-time and removes the entity from default reads, but **keeps** the original fact, its bytes, and its signature. Auditable, reversible. The **default** for "forgetting."
  - **Excise (physical, GDPR Art. 17, `excise`-scoped)** — the **one** operation that breaks pure append-only. It re-folds `/heads` over the remaining set so no excised residue survives, and its marker uses a **non-content-derived nonce** (random id / tenant-salted HMAC) so it is **not a PII fingerprint** (C-4.3). An unauthorized excision marker is **rejected** (closes the censorship/DoS vector, m-11). **Distributed-erasure residual (m7-15):** residue-free `/heads` and byte reclamation hold **on replicas that apply the marker**; a non-compliant/hostile replica, a peer holding `quarantined-ttl` copies until TTL expiry, or **any pre-excision clone** retains the bytes — the erasure guarantee is *organizational* (over the replica set an operator controls or contracts with), not *cryptographic*.

---

## 8.3a Auditability

Every state change is a **signed fact** with provenance, an author-HLC, and (post-hoc, audit-only) a `rxFrom` + commit — so history is a verifiable audit log. `provenanceOf` traces any value to its asserting fact, actor, authority chain, and source.

`fsck` proves:
- `heads == proj(facts)`;
- all **fact** signatures verify;
- every fact's author key chains to the tenant genesis root for its namespace **at the fact's author-HLC**;
- (post-excision) no excised residue survives in `/heads`.

**`fsck` does NOT check commit signatures (M2-2):** commit objects are transport, not trust; fact signatures are the sole trust anchor, so `commit-author ≠ fact-author` on a regenerated DAG is **expected**, not an integrity violation.

**`fsck` is a LOCAL integrity check, not a convergence check (m3-4):** it verifies `heads == proj(local facts)` on *one* replica; it does **not** imply two replicas agree. Cross-replica convergence is INV-2/INV-13's job (see [convergence](./24-synchronization-and-convergence.md) and [conformance](./60-conformance-and-testability.md)). A reader MUST NOT over-trust a green local `fsck` as a convergence guarantee.

---

## 8.3b Resource-exhaustion / DoS threat model (C4-1, m4-5)

The signature-only gate deliberately makes *logical admission* the cheapest possible predicate (one Ed25519 verify) and keeps it byte-pure — which is what SEC needs. The honest threat this creates, and its bound:

### Threat

A holder of **any** key — including a fresh **unregistered** key (registration is `proj`-time, not gate-time) — can sign unlimited distinct signature-valid facts (distinct `factCID` each, so INV-7 dedup does not coalesce them) and `push` them. Logically every replica admits them. **Excision and revocation do NOT bound this** — both *demote* in `proj`, they do **not** reclaim bytes, and the attacker can mint unlimited fresh unregistered keys, so there is no single key to revoke that stops the flood.

### Bound (the C4-1 fix — §3.5a)

Membership purity is **NOT** the place to fix this (a membership gate re-opens C3-1/M3-4 divergence). Instead, **durable STORAGE is the bounded resource**, via the transport-layer admission-control & retention policy (§3.5a, [git substrate](./22-git-substrate.md)). The set-pure `RetentionClass` (computed identically on every replica, never a `proj` value):

| `RetentionClass` | For | Policy |
|---|---|---|
| `durable` | trusted (registered, in-namespace, non-revoked, plausible) facts | **never evicted** |
| `key-chain-durable` | a registered key's own emissions (incl. its quarantined/anachronistic chain links) | preferentially retained up to per-key `keyChainDurableCapBytes`; oldest cap-evicted, re-fetched on demand (M6-1) |
| `quarantined-ttl` | an **unregistered** key's facts | per-key byte-cap + TTL + **global `quarantinePoolBytes` budget**; eviction-eligible |
| `evicted` | bytes reclaimed | re-fetchable on demand if it later becomes durable |

A replica applying the default retention policy therefore admits the flood **logically** (preserving convergence and late-registration races) but bounds the **bytes**, and the flood **never affects `/heads`** (those facts project `quarantined`). The quota lives at **transport**, out of `proj`.

### Aggregate bound — the unlimited-identity defense (m5-1)

A per-key byte cap alone is **not** a global bound (`N` fresh keys give `N × quarantineKeyCapBytes`). The default policy therefore caps the **aggregate** `quarantined-ttl` pool by a manifest-pinned **global `quarantinePoolBytes` budget** with LRU/TTL eviction across **all** unregistered keys, so an `N`-key flood cannot multiply the ceiling or refill faster than TTL/LRU drains. The TTL is the time-ceiling; `quarantinePoolBytes` is the space-ceiling; per-key `quarantineKeyCapBytes` is a *fairness* sub-limit, not the aggregate bound.

### Registered-key (insider) DoS — the cap covers the CHAIN pool; the TRUSTED flood is revocation-latency-bounded (M6-1, scoped honestly)

An attacker with a **registered** key is the insider threat, bounded by:
1. the per-registered-key **`keyChainDurableCapBytes` cap** on the `key-chain-durable` pool — **a real eviction cap (M6-1)**: past the cap the oldest chain links are evicted (re-fetched on demand if later needed), so a registered or compromised-registered key cannot grow the *chain-anchor* pool without bound. (The former "never-evict" wording was an internal contradiction with "bounded by per-key quota" and is **retracted**; the cap makes that quota *true* and enforceable.) **The cap does NOT cover the key's TRUSTED facts** — those are `durable`, never evicted, by definition (§3.5a) — so a compromised registered key flooding valid in-namespace facts forces durable growth at its trusted-write rate **until a `revoke-key` lands**: for the trusted-flood vector, **the real bound is revocation latency** (detect + issue + propagate; deployment-dependent, unquantified), optionally tightened by the MAY per-key transport quota (§3.5a).
2. **revocation** (§8.1) — the load-bearing bound for the trusted-flood vector above;
3. the **per-key chain-completeness anti-backdating gate** (C5-1) — `pending`s/demotes any backdate that contradicts the key's own chain, so an insider cannot silently backdate a trusted fact onto a victim by inducing eviction.

A replica that **opts out** of retention (stores everything) re-exposes itself to *disk growth* — admission control is a **MAY**, not a mandate — but opting out does **NOT** re-open C5-1 (the completeness gate is part of `proj`, independent of the retention knob).

### Accepted residual — re-fetch liveness cliff (m6-3)

A pre-registration chain link (or a cap-evicted `key-chain-durable` link) that has aged out of **every** replica leaves no peer to re-fetch from, so the chain cannot complete and dependent same-key facts stay **`pending` permanently** — never a wrong *trusted* value, but a permanent liveness loss for that key. Mitigation (operational): size `keyChainDurableCapBytes`/`quarantineTtlMs` to the working set and register keys before their pre-registration facts age out. Listed honestly in [§9 / R3](./90-open-questions.md).

### Re-fetch churn amplification (noted; contract deferred to OQ-8)

Evict/re-fetch cycling is a bandwidth-amplification surface: an attacker who can induce cap pressure can make victims repeatedly re-fetch evicted chain links, and a late registration flipping a large `quarantined-ttl` corpus to `key-chain-durable` (§3.5a) triggers a correlated fetch storm. Neither cost is bounded by the spec; the serving/rate-limit/backoff contract that would bound them is **[OQ-8](./90-open-questions.md)**. Until then operators SHOULD rate-limit promisor fetches at the transport.

### Consistency with the "real PKI" claim

Unlimited unauthenticated keys can *push*, but cannot force unbounded **durable** growth or affect any **trusted** head. The §8.1 PKI model and this DoS bound are mutually consistent: trust is a `proj` demotion (value), storage is a transport quota (bytes), and neither touches the signature-only membership gate.

---

## Where this is tested

The trust/tenancy/DoS guarantees here are conformance-checked by **INV-6** (gate/proj separation), **INV-10** (authority chain, author-HLC keyed), **INV-13** (signature-valid ⇒ admitted-on-receipt), **INV-15** (`causedBy` well-formedness), **INV-16** (per-key anti-backdating, chain-completeness gated), **INV-17** (revocation intent + `kip:revoked-concurrent` + `re-attest`), **INV-18** (admission-control/retention + aggregate bound + per-shared-subset SEC), and **INV-19** (anti-backdating under eviction). See [conformance & testability](./60-conformance-and-testability.md).
