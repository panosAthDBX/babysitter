# kip-sdk Documentation

> The entry point: every pre-development doc, grouped by cluster, with a one-line purpose and its
> spec source — plus a suggested reading order.

**Source:** whole-spec map of `../SPEC.md`.

> **`../SPEC.md` (~3.9k lines) remains the single authoritative source.** This documentation set is a
> faithful decomposition for pre-development reading and planning. Where any doc and the spec
> disagree, the spec wins. Companion sources: `../PRIOR-ART.md` (prior-art survey) and
> `../SCORECARD.md` (six-round adversarial convergence record).

kip-sdk (**K**nowledge / **I**nference / **P**rovenance) is a git-substrate, bitemporal, signed-fact
property-graph memory: a **library, not a runtime**, whose unit of synchronization is an append-only
signed temporal fact, so coordinator-free agent replicas converge mechanically at the substrate and
supersede semantically above it. Start with [Vision & scope](./00-vision-and-scope.md).

## The convergence core (read these to understand the load-bearing guarantees)

These five invariants run through every document; nothing in the set may contradict them.

- **Signature-only ingest gate** (§3.2) — only a valid Ed25519 signature decides set membership.
- **Set-pure `proj`** (§3.4) — the read model is a deterministic, total, order-independent fold.
- **SEC** (§4b.4) — convergence = set-convergence + projection determinism.
- **Accelerator boundary** (§5.3) — ANN/embeddings are best-effort, not byte-identical.
- **N5 no-fallbacks** + **INV-A1 microagents-are-clients** — nothing is silently chosen; microagents
  never write the substrate directly.

### For maintainers (implementation-facing)

These docs describe the **built package** (`src/`), not the pre-development spec — read them when
changing code. See also the package [README](../README.md) and the consumer
[getting-started guide](./guide/getting-started.md).

| Doc | Purpose | Source |
|---|---|---|
| [maintainer/architecture.md](./maintainer/architecture.md) | Tour of the real current module layout (`src/`), the layering, and the invariants a change must preserve. | built `src/` |
| [maintainer/conformance-guide.md](./maintainer/conformance-guide.md) | How the self-guarding conformance suite works and how to add a new `INV-*` test. | `src/__tests__/conformance/` + [60](./60-conformance-and-testability.md) |
| [maintainer/contributing.md](./maintainer/contributing.md) | House rules, prerequisites, the `DEBTS.md` convention, the TDD/adversarial-review workflow, and the build/test gates. | [DEBTS.md](./DEBTS.md) + repo CLAUDE.md |

### Security & planning

| [70-decision-records-adr.md](./70-decision-records-adr.md) | Distill the spec's key decisions into ADR-format records (context / decision / consequences / rejected alternatives). No new decisions. | all D-*/C-*/M-* across the spec |
| [80-roadmap-and-milestones.md](./80-roadmap-and-milestones.md) | Pre-dev implementation roadmap: milestone ordering (substrate → proj → sync → retrieval → active layer), dependencies, what each milestone delivers. Planning only. Drills down into [81](./81-roadmap-epics-and-tasks.md) for the epic/task/subtask WBS. | synthesis (arch + requirements) |
| [81-roadmap-epics-and-tasks.md](./81-roadmap-epics-and-tasks.md) | INDEX for the detailed dependency-ordered WBS behind [80](./80-roadmap-and-milestones.md): legend, id scheme, and the full task-level mermaid dependency graph. The 13 epics → 76 tasks → 193 subtasks (each with Implements (FR/NFR) / Exit criteria (INV) / Depends-on edges) are split across 11 per-milestone files, [81a](./81a-tasks-m0.md) (M0) through [81j](./81j-tasks-m9.md) (M9) plus [81k](./81k-tasks-cross-cutting.md) (cross-cutting SDK-surface/tooling epics E11/E13). | synthesis (SPEC + docs/10,11,60,80) |
