/**
 * Milestone D — PRODUCTION wiring of the tool-layer gates into the genty run
 * (§9.4 / AC-49 / AC-45).
 *
 * The genty session (`AgentCoreSessionOptions.policyToolGate`) and the genty MCP
 * dispatcher (`McpRoutingOptions.policyGate`) are LOAD-BEARING blocking gates, but they
 * were never populated in production — the `if (gate)` checks were dead. This helper
 * builds the gate ONCE per workspace (via the policy-adapter's `loadPolicyEnforcementGate`,
 * which verifies the pinned config manifest and constructs coverage + authorization
 * resolution from the verified config) and hands the run its `policyToolGate` /
 * `mcpPolicyGate` callbacks.
 *
 * POSTURE (mirrors Milestone C's loadTrustedBreakpointPolicy):
 *   - anchor pinned (`POLICY_CONFIG_ROOT_FP` set) → enforcement ACTIVE by default; a
 *     covered action without a valid CommandAuthorization is DENIED on the real path with
 *     no extra caller wiring, and a config error denies every covered action (fail closed).
 *   - anchor NOT pinned → `undefined` gate; the run paths are unchanged (back-compat).
 *
 * The gate is memoized per workspace so repeated session/effect construction within one
 * run does not re-verify the manifest each time.
