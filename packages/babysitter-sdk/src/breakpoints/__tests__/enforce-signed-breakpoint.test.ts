/**
 * Milestone C — ENFORCED signed human breakpoints (SDK).
 *
 * Frozen tests authored from docs/design/proof-based-policy-enforcement.md:
 *   - §11 AC-28 (spoofed approval: fabricated `approved:true` with no valid human
 *     signature must be rejected — closes the current spoofable gap where SDK
 *     task_post / commitEffectResult accept UNSIGNED answers today, research §3);
 *   - AC-4 (new breakpoint approvals are signed evidence; the enforcement gate is
 *     consulted in the task_post / commitEffectResult path);
 *   - §5 step 7 / §7 (an unsigned or wrong-signer approval fails verification);
 *   - AC-48/§3.2 (a proven answer whose `approved` bit is NOT inside the signed set
 *     is treated as unsigned → reject).
 *
 * ENFORCEMENT CONTRACT (Milestone C wires this gate into the SDK breakpoint commit
 * path — proven-verification.ts consulted from task_post / commitEffectResult):
 *   - When the policy for a breakpoint REQUIRES a signature, an UNSIGNED answer, or
 *     one with an INVALID / wrong-key / tampered signature, is REJECTED: the commit
 *     is refused, the effect stays PENDING, no EFFECT_RESOLVED is emitted
 *     (fail-closed).
 *   - A validly-signed answer is ACCEPTED.
 *   - When a signature is NOT required (back-compat, the pre-Milestone-C default),
 *     an unsigned answer is UNAFFECTED — the gate does not break existing runs.
 *
 * This file imports from the intended module path the Milestone-C implementation
 * WILL provide: `../enforce-signed-breakpoint` exporting `enforceSignedBreakpointAnswer`.
 * Module resolution MAY fail until the milestone lands — that is expected; there are
 * no syntax errors here. Adversarial cases MUST fail closed (reject → effect pending).
 *
 * The gate is authored as a PURE decision function (no filesystem / run wiring) so it
 * is unit-testable; the runtime wiring (task_post → commitEffectResult) is exercised
 * end-to-end in Milestone E.
